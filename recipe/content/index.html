            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>This is my mom's chilli recipe that she makes and it serves as a comfort food for me. I usually meal prep
                it for the week and eat it for most dinners with a side of salad. I really like it but it isn't anything
                that special. Additionally, I will take more photos of the process when I make it next for this project.
                It is solely a basic chilli recipe surrounding Kroger's Original Chilli spices mix.</p>

                        Apron: </a> The imagery is great: it shows all the ingredients listed with roughly the right
                    amounts. I think the font could be bigger in some places with better spacing between images and
                    text. Color scheme appears clean which is appealing for food. </li>

                        Fresh: </a> Interface is a little overcrowded as there are a lot of things going on with a
                    somewhat strange grid with strange spacing. I like the color scheme and font which makes it very
                    readible.</li>

                        Byte$: </a> I like the boxy kind of cartoony buttons and highlights I think it makes it more
                    beginner friendly feeling and less professional which is what I am going for on my site. The white
                    space on the right side provided by the aside window not scrolling with the window is a little
                    strange and a waste of a lot of screen realestate.</li>

                <li><a href="https://designsystemsrepo.com/design-systems/"> Design Systems Repo: </a> The design of
                    this sight is vey clean and the colors are pretty un-aggresive, but still bright which I like. It is
                    kind of the epitome of minimalism when it comes to design.</li>
                <li><a href="https://bryantcodes.art/"> Bryant Personal Portfolio: </a> I know we aren't using
                    interactive elements for this project, but I really enjoyed the child-like feel of this site. I want
                    my recipes and recipe site to be very friendly and approachable so I like a lot of the cartoony
                    elements of this site.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.lingscars.com/"> Ling's Cars:</a> I like the colorful out there feel of this
                    website. I think there is too much going on so if I take from this I will get a bad grade in this
                    class, but maybe there are bits and pieces I can get inspired by without all the clutter.</li>
