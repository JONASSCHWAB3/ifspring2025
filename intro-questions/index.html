        <li>Jonas Schwab, Computer Science, Junior</li>
        <li>I have done a bit of UI work via a summer internship. I have taken the Website Development class. I took
            this class to touch up on my CSS and HTML skillset as I have been too foused on Javascript lately and want
            to refocus on the basics. I struggle also with the design side of things as well as making flexible
            interfaces that adjust accross different screen sizes. Overall, just want to touch up on CSS and HTML as I
            have forgotten most of it. <strong>I am essentially starting from zero.</strong></li>
        <li>My only experience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript is the 240 Website Development class.</li>
        <li>I want to learn how to use grids properly to make dynamic websites that can adapt for phone screens,
            tablets, desktops, etc...</li>
        <li>I don't really have experience designing on paper besides very rough wireframes. But I think it is different
            since designing for screens very quickly becomes inherently a higher fidelity, so it is more time intensive,
            but produces a more accurate and
            clean product that better represents the end goal.</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Designing for screens your tools and options are more limited. In that you rely on software and hardware
            invented by other people.</li>
        <li>Designing for on paper your tools and options are less limited. You can use any mediums you want, but when
            it comes to the detailed quality it may suffer as computers can design more with more precision.</li>
        <li>I tend to personally design on paper as a first step before investing more time into designing on a computer
            for on screen applications.</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/us-edu/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-air/11-inch-display-256gb-purple-wifi">Apple's
                Shop:</a> I think Apple's website exemplifies effective design as it is very simple and sleek, it
            directs the users attention to stron and stunning visuals of their products. Their user base includes many
            people including those with less experience interacting with websites, so keeping their interface and
            interactions simple allows for the website to be intuitive and very attractive to all users. The off-whites
            and light greys also provides an aesthetic modern looking page in line with the product they are selling.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com"> Amazon's Hompage:</a> Amazon takes a different approach including as much
            information and content onto their page, almost overcrowding it, but this enhances the site's communication
            as anything a user could want is findable on one page. They also use user feedback to decide what to keep on
            the page based on numbers of clicks and user traffic. Therefore they can discern which items or paths to
            keep on the homepage. This allows for great communication as the user can find and interact with anything
            they are looking for from the homepage, but does lend itself to a less attractive design compared to
            Apple's.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.economist.com/">The Economist's Homepage:</a> I use 'The Economist' to read most of my
            news. I like their interface I think it is a good mix of designing for the user's aesthetic pleasure and
            also designing based on functionalit. They include plenty of topical articles on their homepage, while
            keeping an appropriate amount of white space. The typography and and slick grid they have on their homepage
            lends itself to feel very organized and tidy.</li>
