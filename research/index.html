                        Apron: </a> The imagery is great: it shows all the ingredients listed with roughly the right
                    amounts. I think the font could be bigger in some places with better spacing between images and
                    text. Color scheme appears clean which is appealing for food. </li>
                <li><a href="https://www.hellofresh.com/recipes/when-steak-met-potatoes-5857fcd16121bb11c124f383">Hello
                        Fresh: </a> Interface is a little overcrowded as there are a lot of things going on with a
                    somewhat strange grid with strange spacing. I like the color scheme and font which makes it very
                    readible.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.budgetbytes.com/beef-stroganoff/">Budget
                        Byte$: </a> I like the boxy kind of cartoony buttons and highlights I think it makes it more
                    beginner friendly feeling and less professional which is what I am going for on my site. The white
                    space on the right side provided by the aside window not scrolling with the window is a little
                    strange and a waste of a lot of screen realestate.</li>

            <h2>Non-Recipe Website Inspiration</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://designsystemsrepo.com/design-systems/"> Design Systems Repo: </a> The design of
                    this sight is vey clean and the colors are pretty un-aggresive, but still bright which I like. It is
                    kind of the epitome of minimalism when it comes to design.</li>
                <li><a href="https://bryantcodes.art/"> Bryant Personal Portfolio: </a> I know we aren't using
                    interactive elements for this project, but I really enjoyed the child-like feel of this site. I want
                    my recipes and recipe site to be very friendly and approachable so I like a lot of the cartoony
                    elements of this site.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.lingscars.com/"> Ling's Cars:</a> I like the colorful out there feel of this
                    website. I think there is too much going on so if I take from this I will get a bad grade in this
                    class, but maybe there are bits and pieces I can get inspired by without all the clutter.</li>
